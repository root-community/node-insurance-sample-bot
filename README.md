# Root Insurance Sample Bot (Node.js)

A sample bot backed by [DialogFlow](https://console.dialogflow.com) that interacts with the Root Insurance API to issue Term Life policies.

## How To Run

1) Install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`
2) Add a `.env` file in the root directory with the following enviroment variables:
    ```
    # HTTP port to listen on (defaults to 3000)
    APP_PORT=3000

    # Your Root API key, as generated in your Organization settings
    ROOT_API_KEY=...

    # Root API base URL to use (defaults to https://sandbox.root.co.za/v1/insurance)
    ROOT_BASE_URL=https://sandbox.root.co.za/v1/insurance
    ```
3) Start the app with `npm run dev` - this will run the app using [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for auto-restart on changes

PS: You'll also likely want to point your DialogFlow Fulfillment to your app using [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com).
